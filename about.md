<p>I'm	 William Walcher, and I'm a software developer originally from Minnesota who's currently pursuing a BSc. in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. </p>

<p>In between classes I enjoy working on personal projects, some of which you'll find on this website, as well as my GitHub. I'm also heavily involved with UBC's Computer Science Student Society and served as the First Year Representative this past year. I will be going on to serve as the Vice President Social this coming year, where I work to organize events that build the CS community within UBC. I've also been involved in organizing hackathons in the past, including one that I started, and others for high school students as a regional manager at StudentRND.</p>

<p>I'm currently seeking an internship for Summer 2019. If you'd like to get in touch, don't hesitate to send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:hello@williamwalcher.xyz">hello@williamwalcher.xyz</a></p>
